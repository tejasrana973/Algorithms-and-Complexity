# Algorithms & Complexity

This repo contains almost all contents of the MTH407 course @IISERM.

**Course Outline:**
1. Review of Turing machines and algorithms as implemented using them.
2. Sorting and searching algorithms (including data structures like balanced search trees, heaps etc).
3. Tree and graph traversal: depth-first and breadth-first search with applications (e.g. finding biconnected components of a graph in linear time).
4. Algorithm paradigms like divide-and-conquer, the greedy method (minimum spanning tree algorithms, some matroid theory), dynamic programming algorithms, backtracking and branch-and-bound.
5. Complexity of algorithms. NP-Complete and NP-Hard.
